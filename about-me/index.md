# About Me:

### Professional Life

I recently moved to New York to pursue a career as a data scientist as I finish writing my dissertation. My background is in psychology and neuroscience research, and my PhD has focused on using functional MRI to investigate atypical brain function. In between my graduate studies at UC Davis and undergraduate studies at MIT, I taught high school algebra and physics in San Francisco. 


### Personal Life

I love data and enjoy finding ways to bring together my skills and interests through small side projects. As I learn new technical skills, I enjoy testing them out on data related to baking or my favorite TV shows. I also love to experiment in the kitchen and am always looking for a new recipe to try.
